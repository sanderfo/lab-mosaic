# Lab: Image mosaics from feature matching
In this lab we will experiment with feature detection and matching to extract point correspondences between two images.
We will then use these correspondences to estimate a homography between the images, which will enable us to create a live video mosaic!

Start by cloning this repository on your machine.
Then open the lab project in CLion.

The lab is carried out by following these steps:
1. [Get an overview](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md)
2. [Features in OpenCV](lab-guide/2-features-in-opencv.md)
3. [Experiment with feature matching](lab-guide/3-experiment-with-feature-matching.md)
4. [Homography estimation](lab-guide/4-homography-estimation.md)
5. [Creating an image mosaic](lab-guide/5-creating-an-image-mosaic.md) 

You will find our proposed solution at https://github.com/tek5030/solution-mosaic. 
Please try to solve the lab with help from others instead of just jumping straight to the solution ;)

Please start the lab by going to the [first step](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md).
